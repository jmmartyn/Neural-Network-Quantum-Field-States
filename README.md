# Neural Network Quantum Field States

In recent years, machine learning has inspired the application of neural networks to problems in quantum physics, leading to a new variational ansatz known as a [neural-network quantum state](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag2302). Predicated on the varitaional principle, this ansatz parameterizes a wave function by neural networks, which are optimized over to approximate a ground state. NQSs has seen succcessful applications to [spin chains](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0545-1), [quantum chemsitry](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033429), and beyond.

In [Neural-Network Quantum States for Continuum Quantum Field Theory](link), we develop neural-network quantum field states (NQFSs) as a variational ansatz for quantum fidle theory, thus extending the range of NQS to quantum field theories directly in the continuum. In this work, we study non-relativstic bosonic field theories. We model the corresponding NQFS by its Fock space representation as a superposition of $n$-particle wave functions, $$\varphi_n^\text{NQFS}(\textbf{x}_n)$$
